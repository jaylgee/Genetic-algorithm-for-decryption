# Genetic algorithm for decryption

## This genetic algorithm was developed as part of my coursework for Udemy's Lazy Programmer Machine Learning course. It takes an piece of text encrypted by assigning each letter of the alphabet with a number between one and twenty-six, like a CodeWords puzzle. The genetic algorithm then tries to find the most likely solution to decrypt the text. This algorithm works most of the time. Occasionally, it gets 'trapped' in a local minima and its best solution is way off. If this happens, re-run it and it should generate a good solution. It still tends to get two letters incorrect because they are so rarely occurring that there is insufficient material to allow the algorithm to find the optimal solution.
